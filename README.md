### Multi-Channel SARCloud
- This indicator is to be used with TradingView
- It combines Bollinger Bands, Keltner Channels, Donchain Channels, Ichimoku Cloud, and SAR. 
- All of these indicators are lagging, but combining them provides an enhanced visual representation of trends/consolidation

### Multi-Channel Cloud

- Similar to the previous indicator, but this one removes SAR and Donchain.
- There is also an extra channel added to the Keltner channel
- Ideally
    - long when the cloud is thick and green and candles are trading in the upper channels.
    - short when the cloud is thick and red and candles are trading in the lower channels.
